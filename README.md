**Assignment 1 :**

Polynomial class implementation

**Assignment 2 :**

(1) program to implement a queue using 2 stacks. 

(2) program of Tower-of-Hanoi non-recursively using stack
                
**Assignment 3 :**

(1) Implementation of  Josephus Problem using circular linked list 

(2) merge and merge-sort functions without using additional intermediate storage.
                
**Assignment 4 :** 

(1) programs to traverse a binary tree in preorder and postorder non-recursively

(2) program to create a binary tree having preorder threads. Write another program to traverse the tree in preorder using those threads
               
**Assignment 5 :**

(1) program to compute the k closest elements from a key value x that belongs to the array A[n] of n data items (using QuickSort ) 

(2) program that inputs a DAG (directed acyclic graph) G = (V, E) and an ordering a of the vertices of G. The program returns TRUE if a is a topological sort G                     or FALSE if a is not a topological sort of G
